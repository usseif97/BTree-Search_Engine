What do you know about Blomberg R&D team?

They're basically in charge of all technological aspects of Bloomberg's work.
In particular, It's is a global team of more than 3,000 software engineers
responsible for creating the worldÕs premiere source for real-time and historical financial market data and analytics.

what do you know about Bloomberg
==================================
Bloomberg is a financial data vendor that provides professionals in finance with all the data they need in real time along with news, analytics and every thing they need in order to make informed business decisions.
the company provides data, news and analytics to decision makers in industries beyond finance.
provides financial data for companies to make informed descisions. every one sees the same data at the same time. 

The core product of bloomberg is the bloomberg terminal which is a fantastic technological platform that delivers comprehensive financial information and provides people in finance with all the real time data they need, news even a chat system all in one place.
no one firm that has the entire large-scale finance community online and together in one place.

Why Bloomberg
================
Interning at bloomberg would be a great opportunity for me to grow as a software engineer,
writing software that is actually used everyday by finance professionals seems like a very 
interesting thing to do,
bloomberg has alot of project in almost all of cs fields, you could be working on a new function 
for the terminal,
writing software libraries for other engineers to use and many other that id like to contribute 
to.

-My passion for data-driven engineering and machine learning, even if i didn't work on that topic 
- Impact, real products, real users
- Open and non-restrictive hierarchy culture, a rare thing in the industry.
- Largest/Most-successful/Global of its kind.
- The Pioneer in a lot of things: using computers in exchanging info, 
- Transparency and Integrity: it's really easy to fall to pieces in the financial market.
 
whatever you are working on, knowing that the products you build will be 
used by financial professionals around the world is definitely something great.

i want to see how the work is done behind the scenes how does the terminal work and
how data is imported/extracted presented.

You will get to build products that thousands of finance professionals actually use on a daily basis, which is great. When things work great, or when things break, you will hear about it firsthand. Project cycles are very fast, so if you're concerned about building a huge piece of software that doesn't really get to see the light of day (think many Google products), that will not happen at Bloomberg.

who uses bloombeg
==================
Overall, the idea of a corporation having a Bloomberg is to not be taken advantage of. Lots of 
banks look at corporations in the same way airport currency-changers look at a first-time 
tourist. Corporations have lots of cash, lots of transactions to do, and little competitive 
advantage in doing them, compared to the other types banks interact with like hedge funds and 
investment firms. This isn't any indictment of corporations. After all, their primary business is 
moving people in pressurized aluminum tubes, or marketing soda, not moving money around. 

Bloomberg levels the playing field, and allows a corporation to shop its business around. Rather 
than calling one broker to get a quote on a transaction, they can see exactly where the market 
is, and transact accordingly. 

The value for a non-financial corporation falls into three main categories: Risk Management, 
Investor Relations, and Cash/Pension/Treasury Management. 

Risk Management: Having a Bloomberg Terminal can help manage three different types of risk
Commodity Risk includes the aforementioned oil price risk, which a company like Lufthansa is most 
concerned about. It also includes agricultural products like sugar and corn which impact Coke's 
costs in a major way.
Interest Rate Risk includes mismatches in income and obligations. Lots of cash management is done 
at extremely short durations, whereas debt is issued at longer terms. Sometimes one side of this 
is based on floating interest rates and the other on fixed. These mismatches create a huge 
liability.
Foreign Exchange Risk is the risk inherent of having revenues and costs in different currencies. 
Coca Cola makes revenue in every currency under the sun, but at some point, once it has covered 
its local costs, it's going to have to convert that profit back to USD. 

In Investor Relations, companies can track their performance relative to competitors, changes in 
holdings (who owns their stock), news tied to their company, etc. Most importantly, they can see 
what the buyside (investor) sees.

Lastly, the cash management piece is about tracking money that corporations have on hand to 
conduct their day-to-day business, like making payroll, etc. That cash never sits in a bank. It's 
almost always kept in short-term, highly liquid securities and money market funds so the company 
earns some interest. Some companies also have pension funds for their employees, in which case a 
team of investors operates what amounts to an internal mutual fund.
